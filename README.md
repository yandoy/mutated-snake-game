# mutated-snake-game
Using neural networks and the genetic algorithm I created a 0-player game were you get to see the different snakes and how they use diffenret stratergies to obtain the goal of eating an apple. As the genetic algorithm sorts out the best snake stratergies does succeed and make it to the next game, within 20-30 iterations you have a pro snake.
